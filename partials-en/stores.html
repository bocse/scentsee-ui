            ScentSee is a recommender system built to fix the pains of fragrance retailers: consumers have a hard time making a decision, they delay the purchase and often don't know where to start sampling.

		</p>
		<p>
            Moreover, the fragrance consultant is often overloaded with tens or hundreds of new perfumes every season. ScentSee is also a tool to make the consultant's job easier, the recommendations faster and more relevant, allowing store workers to help more customers in the same amount of time.
		</p>
		<p>	
			Our solution brings relevance and structure to the conversation between the consultant and the customer, thus smoothing the way towards the purchase decision.

            The recommender system work keeps relevance, clarity of relayed information and ease of use as its core principle.
            The interface is intuitive for customer and sales consultant alike. Therefore, the customer can even interact with your version of ScentSee independently, during those times when consultants are overcrowded.

		<p>
			We can deliver ScentSee in your store, regardless of whether it is brick&mortar or online. Moreover, the recommendations made by ScentSee are always in sync with your stock, so you can deliver the most value out of each interaction.
